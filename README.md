As part of our Stats 201 course, we were taked with engineering a measurement system that could measure the length and width of a block with pinpoint accuracy without the need of a caliper. AN ESP32 board was used to faciliate communication between the peripherals such as the dc motors and the master computer which included computer vision algoritms to estimate the state and position of the block.
